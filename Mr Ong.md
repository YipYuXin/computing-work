***Mr Ong da Science tea-cher***

>Ever since he came to teach us, we never stopped laughing. 
That's because his jokes are just too good, and maybe... cringy(?).
People always say that he tells all the good jokes, now all of them Argon.
But still, he comes up with new jokes every lessin to make us remember the concepts better.
And I strongly believe that there will be an element called Adrianium, the element of creativity.
After all, he's the one that shared the jokes to make us laugh every single time. 
Although my Science grades aren't that great, I believe that just by listening to his jokes my grades would improve.
That is how genius he is.
And outstanding.
And amazing.
Isn't that the best a teacher can be?
