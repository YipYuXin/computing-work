***Mr Ong da Science tea-cher***

Ever since he came to teach us, we never stopped laughing. 
That's because his jokes are just too good, and maybe... cringy?
People always say that he tells all the good jokes, now all of them Argon.
But still, he comes up with new jokes every lessin to make us remember the concepts better.
And I strongly believe that there will be an element called Adrianium, the element of creativity.
After all, he's the one that created the jokes to make us laugh and... uh... c... cri... cringe every single time. 
Although my Science grades aren't that great, I feel that just by memorising all his jokes my grades would improve drastically.
That is how genius he is.
And outstanding.
And amazing.
Isn't that the best a teacher can be?
