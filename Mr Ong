Mr Ong da Science tea-cher
Ever since he came to teach us, the class never stopped laughing. 
That's because his jokes were just too good, and maybe... cringy.
People always say that he speaks all the good jokes, now all of them Argon.
But still, he comes up with new jokes every lesson to make us remember the concepts better.
And I strongly believe that there will be an element called Adrianium, the element of creativity.
After all, he's the one that shared the jokes to make us laugh everytime. 
Although my Science grades aren't that great, I believe that just by listening to his jokes the grades would improve.
That is how genius he is.
And outstanding.
And amazing.
